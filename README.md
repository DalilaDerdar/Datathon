# Hackathon on data and music
With my team, we took up the challenge of writing a data solution for the music industry, in 24 hours! Passionate about answering business problems, we decided to answer a recurring one for the professional musicians: how sure can they be that the songs they create will find their audience? In other words, how can one predict the popularity of musical compositions?

Through the analysis of the technical characteristics of the created song and based on the analysis of the characteristics of other songs in the same musical genre, we have designed an algorithm that predicts the popularity of the artist's song. Is built around a learning machine model (KNN) using python language.
